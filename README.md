# Greetings!

I'm narloid, a Canadian (aspiring) programmer and (aspiring) musician. You can reach me @ narloid#4625 on discord, or [my twitter](https://twitter.com/narloid).

## Things I am learning

### Rust
Reasons: A fun syntax to use, an actual package manager (looking at you C++) and free and comprehensive learning resources

### C++
Reasons: I honestly really don't know, but it might be useful in case I want to work with UE in the future

### The UNIX/Linux shell
Reasons: Handy to use, and a necessity since I run Debian with crostini every day on my chromebook

### Music Theory/Sheet Music
Reasons: I like making cool and funny noises and I want to make them sound good
